# Lost Instrument

[TOC]

## 1. Description

### 1.1 Overview

We use **Unity3D** to develop a 3D interactive system called ***Lost Instrument*** as our final *Human-Computer Interaction* course project. 

**Unity3D** is a ultimate game development platform. Though it is mainly used to design 3D games, we can also use it to build a system that presents 3D products to users.

In our final project, we find three 3D models for three Chinese traditional musical instruments: *erhu*, *zither* and *lute* on the Internet and use 3D Studio Max to make them more beautiful . Every model is consist of small components and we distract these components from the models to make their own 3D models. In our **Unity3D** project, we import these three models and present them to users. Users can interact with our models by clicking on buttons our objects to listen to the music played by the instrument, get a closer look on the instrument, see the instrument fall apart into small parts and so on.

The reason why we develop this system is that Chinese traditional musical instruments are the precious wealth of the Chinese nation. Besides, as the professor told us,  3D interfaces are more natural than 2D interfaces for they are more *real*. Though there are many 3D interactive systems of western instruments, 3D interactive systems of traditional instruments are still rare. So we decided to develop a 3D interactive system of traditional instruments.  We call it ***Lost Instrument*** because traditional instruments need more attention now. Our aim is to let more people know about the great treasure of our country by enabling them to use computers to interact with  3D  models of traditional instruments.

### 1.2 Structure and Modules

We design four kinds of  scenes for our project, which are **MainPage**, **chooseScene**, **instrumentScene**( including **erhuScene**, **guzhengScene**, **pipaScene**), **componentScene**( including **qingongScene**, **ganScene**, **xianScene**, **qintongScene**, **shankouScene**, **zhongxianScene**, **mianbanScene**). These scenes have corresponding **C# Scripts** for them to realize the interaction.

#### 1.2.1 MainPage

When our user starts our program, he will first see this scene and can **click** on *START* to go to **chooseScene**.

![MainPage](img\MainPage.png)

#### 1.2.2 chooseScene

In this scene, our user can choose instrument and he can **double-click** on the instrument to go to **instrumentScene**.

![chooseScene1](img\chooseScene1.png)

![chooseScene2](img\chooseScene2.png)

![chooseScene3](img\chooseScene3.png)

![chooseScene4](img\chooseScene4.png)

#### 1.2.3 instrumentScene

In this Scene, our user can interact with the instrument.

##### Erhu

![Erhu](img\Erhu.png)

##### Zither

![Zither](img\Zither.png)

##### Lute

![Lute](img\Lute.png)

#### 1.2.4 componentScene

In this Scene, our user can interact with the component. We create many component scenes and we only show one of them here.

## 2. Implemented Requirements

### 2.1 Interaction in MainPage

![MainPage](img\MainPage.png)

- we use Particle System for the *START* button and it has a fascinating effect.

### 2.2 Interaction in ChooseScene

![chooseScene1](img\chooseScene1.png)

In this scene, we have four features which are as follows.

- our user can **click** on the instrument he wants to see, and then the instrument will rotate to him. Then light will always focus on the instrument in the front.

  ![chooseScene2](img\chooseScene2.png)

- When our user **double-clicks** on the instrument, he can then enter the **instrumentScene**.

- When our user **double-clicks** on the 3D text *Lost Instrument*, he can return to the **MainPage**.

- We provide a *Quit* button for our user and he can **click** on it to quit our program. 

### 2.3 Interaction in instrumentScene

![Erhu](img\Erhu.png)

In this scene, we have nine features which are as follows.

- We provide a *return* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, he will return to the **chooseScene**.

- We provide a *play* button and a *stop* button for our user. When our user **clicks** on the *play* button, the system will play a song played with the corresponding instrument. When our user **clicks** on the *stop* button, the song will stop playing.

- We provide a *forward* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, the camera will move forward and get more closer with the instrument.

  ![cameraForward](img\cameraForward.png)

- We provide a *return* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, the camera will return to its origin place.

- We provide a *separation* button and a *cohesion* button for our user. When our user **clicks** on the *separation* button, the instrument will separate into some components. When our user **clicks** on the *cohesion* button, the separate components will get together again.

  ![ErhuSeparate](img\ErhuSeparate.png)

- When our user **clicks** on a component, the camera will move closer to the component.

  ![closerComponent](img\closerComponent.png)

- When our user **hover** his mouse over a component, the component will be lit up and there will be its name appearing on it.

  ![hovereffect1](img\hovereffect1.png)

  ![hovereffect2](img\hovereffect2.png)

- When our user **double-clicks** on a component, he will enter the scene of the component.

- We provide a *Back* button for our user and he can **click** on it to return to the choose scene.

### 2.4 Interaction in componentScene

![qintong](img\qintong.png)

- We provide a *return* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, he will return to the **instrumentScene**.

- We provide a *forward* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, the camera will move forward and get more closer with the component.

  ![qingtongCloser](img\qingtongCloser.png)

- We provide a *return* button for our user and when he **clicks** on it, the camera will return to its origin place.

- We present a compass on the right, and when our user **clicks** on anywhere in the scene, the component will begin to rotate by a certain angle. We provide a *reset* button and when our user **clicks** on it, the component will return to its origin place.

## 3. Advantages and Disadvantages

### 3.1 Advantages

1. The biggest advantage of our project is that its interface and UI is fascinating. We apply some combined lights to generate special effect, which makes the scene seemed real.
2. The 3D Model of our project is lifelike.
3. The stucture of our program is concise and organized, so it is very easy for us to make some improvement.
4. Since this is a 3D display model interaction, we put the 3D model's presentation in a prominent position, show them with the most interface resources, cut off the extra functions and interface elements, so that the focus becomes more important, let The need for outstanding changes is more prominent.
5. By dividing the content displayed by the 3D model into different levels, the content diversity is increased, and the focus is more prominent.
6. At the same time, our main interaction logic is unified, allowing users to understand and master the functions that can be realized simply and clearly.

### 3.2 Disadvantages

1. We need to add more features to our project such as rotating by the mouse or basic introduction to the instruments.
2. There are still some bugs in our system.
3. We fail to port our program to our mobile phone.
4. We do not have much time after spending lots of time learning Unity3D, so we only apply the rotation to three components.
5. The function realization of user interaction needs to be improved. For example, there is no way to determine the zoomed position according to the position of the user's mouse when zooming, and the user cannot determine the direction and position of the rotation.
6. As far as the method of use is concerned, the guidance to the user is still insufficient. Users still need preliminary exploration to know the logic of interaction.
7. The style of each interface is not uniform enough. The position of the 3D model, the position of the button, and the setting of the environment such as light are still different in different interfaces, so that the user may have a sense of difference when jumping on different interfaces.

##  4. How to Improve Our Program

According to the analysis of our advantages and disadvantages, there are many things we can do to improve our program:

1. We can make full use of the Unity3D engine to add more features.
2. We can add some brief introductions of instruments and components.
3. It is convenient for us to port Unity3D to other platforms, so we could try this after we finish our projects. 

## 5. Development Environment
